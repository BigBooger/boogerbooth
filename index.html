				<h2>Who Even Are You</h2>
				<img src="images/" alt="" width="0" height="0" class="floater">
				<p>I'm Booger and I'm awesome. I go by other names like AidsBooger, PoopBooger, and BoogerDude. I only use those ones because the username "Booger" is taken on most platforms though.</p>
				
				<h2>What Is Booger Booth</h2>
				<img src="images/" alt="" width="0" height="0" class="floater">
				<p>Booger Booth is just for whatever I feel like putting on it. I don't really have all that many plans for this website other than using it as some kind of personal portfolio or something. I'll probably upload stuff that I wanna keep so I can look back on it later like screenshots from games and random doodles. I'm getting back into web development after like 2 years so I'm a little bit rusty and this site is very scuffed at the moment.</p>

				<h2>Random Info</h2>
				
				<p>I might make a separate page for this stuff later but for now this is what ya get.</p>
				
				<p>My Discord is username is boogerdude if ya wanna add me or something. Though you probably found this website through my discord. <br>My Steam page is <a class="link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/BiggestBooger/">here</a>. I have it set to private right now but you can still send a friend request if you want to.<br>My YouTube channel is <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@BoogerPoop" target="_blank">here</a></p>
				
				<hr>
				
				<h2>Even More Random Info</h2>
				<img src="images/" alt="" width="0" height="0" class="floater">
				<p>Just gonna put more info about what I like and stuff here. I'm a huge fan of the band <a class="link" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/38SKxCyfrmNWqWunb9wGHP" target="_blank">Good Kid.</a> They make really upbeat music that I really vibe with. I'm really into music and stuff actually. I play guitar, ukulele, and piano too! I'm also working on a MineCraft server right now (also called boogerbooth) and much like this website I have no idea what to do with it. Also if you're on FireFox im sorry that this website looks super zoomed in. FireFox doesnt support the zoom styling in css as far as I know and I used it to decrease the zoom to 67%.</p>
